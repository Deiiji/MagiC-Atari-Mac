MagiC kernel sources (AES).
Sources are converted to UTF-8.

WARNING:
	Use "atari-utf8-conversion" or command line program "recode" to convert
	to AtariST charset before processing with native Atari toolchain!

NOTE:
	Do not get confused by the Hebrew letters, the UTF-8 editor will change
	their read direction when displaying or editing it, causing the cursor to jump.
